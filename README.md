## 🌱 What Is TOEx?

The **Theory of Exchange (TOEx)** is an original framework that unifies physical, cognitive, ethical, and economic systems — all through the lens of **exchange**.

It proposes that:
> “Everything in existence is defined not by its substance, but by its participation in structured exchange.”

---

## 🔍 Why It Matters

TOEx shows that:
- The same structure that governs gravity can also model decision-making, ethics, or social dynamics.
- Einstein’s equations, quantum fields, control theory, and even consciousness can emerge from **structured interaction**.

It is not just a theory. It is:
- A philosophy of reality.
- A modeling framework.
- A language for networks of being.
